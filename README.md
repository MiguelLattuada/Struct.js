Struct.js
=========

Struct.js is a javascript library that exposes the ArrayList class based on the java class with the same name.

~~Now to get up and running just download the files open the index.html and play in the console with the variables

```javascript
window.struct //An object that contains the ArrayList class.
window.N_LIST //An ArryList of type numeric.
window.CAT_LIST //An ArrayList of custom class Cat
```

You can also see on [the PNG](structure.png) the exposed members of the ArrayList displayed on the console.~~

**The first none standard version of the library is out [here](../../releases).**
