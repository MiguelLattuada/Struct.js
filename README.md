Struct.js
=========

Struct.js is a javascript library that exposes the ArrayList class based on the java class with the same name.
A documentation will be able for the next commit and some changes to the code and reorganization.
Now to get up and running just download the files open the index.html and play in the console with the variables

    window.struct //An object that contains the ArrayList class.
    window.N_LIST //An ArryList of type numeric.
    window.CAT_LIST //An ArrayList of custom class Cat
