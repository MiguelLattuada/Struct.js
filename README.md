Struct.js
=========

Struct.js is a javascript library that exposes the ArrayList class based on the java class with the same name.

Now to get up and running just download the files open the index.html and play in the console with the variables

```javascript
window.struct //An object that contains the ArrayList class.
window.N_LIST //An ArryList of type numeric.
window.CAT_LIST //An ArrayList of custom class Cat
```

You can also see on [the PNG](structure.png) the exposed members of the ArrayList displayed on the console.
